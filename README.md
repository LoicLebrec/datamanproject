The Final_Report.pdf is the direct output of the Quarto file, serving as the main report where the core analysis, methodology, and results were written and processed. 
In contrast, the Final_Report - Data_Management.pdf represents the final report in a structured report format, tailored specifically for visual presentation and summarization purposes.
Both documents contain the same content, the former provides the comprehensive report derived from the Quarto document, whereas the latter is designed for visual clarity and presentation.
